# broMath
broMath is a FOSS website that makes doing your homeworks easier
# Technologies
We use
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Vanilla HTML5
- Vanilla JavaScript, I planned on using TypeScript but I don't like the syntax, feel free to suggest
We use this boring technologies to make the websites fast, this was originally done in Svelte but I felt like this website was simple and didn't need a framework (I know it's a compiler)

If you are wondering you need to enable JavaScript to use this website because we use it to make managing all the pages easier, no tracking is done whatsoever
